# About Me:
I am 21 years old. I work at the Institute of Applied Physics in the laboratory of computational diagnostics as a junior researcher. I think my current job does not allow me to develop. I want to find an occupation that will allow not only to develop as a professional, but also to grow as a person and enjoy it. My goal is to gain theoretical knowledge and practical skills in front-end development.
In my free time I like to ride a bike, listen to music, play table tennis.
**My strengths:**
* Diligent
* Team player
* Honest
* Fast learner
* Careful
